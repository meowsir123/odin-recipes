    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The humble lasagna is an Italian dish made from layering pieces of pasta with
        cheese and tomato sauce and then baking them until golden brown.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 28oz. can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 oz. tomato paste (about 5 Tbsp)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk ricotta</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Italian cheese blend</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp freshly cracked pepper</li>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles (about ½ lb.)</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley (optional garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the Italian sausage to a deep skillet and cook over medium heat until browned. While the sausage is
            cooking, dice the onion and then add it to the skillet with the sausage. Continue to stir and cook until the
            onion has softened (about 3 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and Italian seasoning to the skillet and stir to combine. Partially
            cover the skillet with a lid, turn the heat down to medium-low, and let the sauce simmer while you prepare
            the other ingredients. Stir the sauce occasionally as it cooks.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Add the ricotta cheese, Italian cheese blend, egg, and pepper to a bowl, then
            stir to combine. Set the cheese mixture aside.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with water and add ½ Tbsp salt. Bring the pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add the
            noodles and cook just until tender (about 8 minutes). Drain the noodles in a colander.</li>
        <li>Spread about 1 cup of sauce over the bottom of a 9×13-inch casserole dish. Lay three noodles on top of the
            sauce. Spread ⅓ of the cheese mixture evenly over the noodles. Repeat the layers (sauce, noodles, cheese)
            two more times. Finish with the remaining sauce, then top with the shredded mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with foil and bake for 40 minutes. After 40 minutes, remove the foil, turn the oven from bake
            to broil, and broil for about 5 minutes or just until the cheese gets a little brown on top. Watch the it
            closely as it broils!</li>
        <li>Top with chopped parsley if desired, and slice into nine (or twelve) pieces. Serve and enjoy!</li>
